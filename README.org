** TODOs

- GP for censored regression with error bands that depend on the
  inputs.

** 12 Apr 2019

[[file:figure-binomial-each-label.R]] creates figures for binomial
likelihood to maximize (instead of minimizing 01 loss)

wrote some code to show error bands of predictions for linear model,

Read articles about interval-censored bayesian regression models with
R packages but no regularization.
- JSS, Frequentist icenReg::ic_par, similar to survival::survreg https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v081i12
- R Journal, Bayesian icenReg::ic_bayes https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-050/index.html
- JSS, flexsurv pkg allows user-specified distributions

Wrote some code to verify that the coefs/predictions are all more or
less the same, [[file:icenReg-flexsurv.R]]

- [[file:DPpackage-bug.R]] emailed maintainer, atjara@uc.cl, response: Please try with a older version of r. I am not updating the package and it seems that does not work with recent versions of r. Best, alejandro
