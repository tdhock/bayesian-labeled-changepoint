** TODOs

- Plot distribution of predicted penalties, this should be possible
  with survreg.

** 5 Apr 2019

Read articles about interval-censored bayesian regression models with
R packages but no regularization.
- JSS, Frequentist icenReg::ic_par, similar to survival::survreg https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v081i12
- R Journal, Bayesian icenReg::ic_bayes https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-050/index.html
- JSS, flexsurv pkg allows user-specified distributions
  https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v070i08

Wrote some code to verify that the coefs/predictions are all more or
less the same, [[file:icenReg-flexsurv.R]]
